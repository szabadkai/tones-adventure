				<h2>A homebrew Gameboy game</h2>
				<p>Tone's Adventure is an unfinished homebrew Gameboy Color game programmed in C using the <a href="http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/">Gameboy Developer Kit (GBDK) library</a>. I worked on it during late 2011 to early 2012. This was a very cool project to work on, and I hope to come back to it someday!</p>
                <h2>Open-source</h2>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/shamblesides/tones-adventure">The code for this game is on GitHub!</a> If you want to make a Gameboy game yourself, this may be worth checking out.</p> 
				<h2>How to play it yourself</h2>
				<p>Below are ROM's from various points in development. To run these, download a gameboy emulator, such as <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vba/">VisualBoy Advance</a>. To play it on an actual Gameboy Color, you'll need to buy some kind of writable Gameboy cartridge, such as <a href="http://store.kitsch-bent.com/product/usb-64m-smart-card">this one</a>.</p>
